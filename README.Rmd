About
=====

Information on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) is essential to support governments in making decisions about the impact of human activities on the environment, planning the use of natural resources, conserving biodiversity and monitoring climate change.

Currently, several projects systematically provide information on the dynamics of land use and cover. Well known projects include PRODES, DETER and TerraClass.
These projects are developed by INPE and they produce information on land use and coverage used by the Brazilian Government to make public policy decisions.
Besides these projects there are other initiatives from universities and space agencies devoted to the creation of national and global maps.

Although these projects follow open data policies and provide a rich collection of data, there is still a gap in tools that facilitate the integrated use of these collections. Each project adopts its own land use and land cover classification system, providing different class names and meanings for the elements of these collections. The forms of distribution of project data can be carried out in different ways, through files or web services. In addition, the data has different spatial and temporal resolutions and storage systems (raster or vector).

In this context, the **W**eb **L**and **T**rajectory **S**ervice (WLTS) is a service that aims to facilitate the access to these vaapproach consists of using a data model that defines a minimum set of temporal and spatial information to represent different sources and types of data, but with a focus on land use and land cover.

WLTS can be used in a variety of applications, such as validating land cover data sets, selecting training samples to support Machine Learning algorithms used in the generation of new classification maps.

If you want to know more about WLTS service, please, take a look at its [specification](https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/wlts-spec).


## Installation

To install the development version of `rwlts`, run the following commands:

``` {R, eval=FALSE}
# load necessary libraries
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("brazil-data-cube/rwlts")
```

Importing `rwlts` package:

``` {R, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rwlts)
```

## Usage

`rwlts` implements the following WLTS operations:

```{R, echo=FALSE}
tribble(
  ~"**WLTS** operations", ~"`rwlts` functions",
  "`/list_collections`", "`list_collections(URL,)`",
  "`/describe_collections`", "`describe_collection(URL, collection_id)`",
  "`/trajectory`", "`get_trajectory(URL, latitude, longitude)`"
) %>% as.data.frame() %>% knitr::kable(format = "markdown")
```

These functions can be used to retrieve information from a WLTS API service. The code bellow creates a `wlts` object and list the available collections of the WLTS API of the Brazil Data Cube project of the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research INPE.

### List Collections

The first operation, `list_collections`, retrieves all available collections in WLTS service.


``` {R, echo=TRUE}
wlts_bdc <- "https://brazildatacube.dpi.inpe.br/wlts/"

list_collections(wlts_bdc)
```

### Describle Collection

Each collection returned by the WLTS service can be used for retrieving LULC trajectories. To get information about the collections, we use the `describe_collection` function. This function returns the metadata of a given collection, which includes the description and specific details. The metadata also describes the spatio-temporal extent of the collection. 

In the code below, we retrieve the metadata from the `deter_amazonia_legal` collection using the `describe_collection` function.


``` {R, echo=TRUE}
describe_collection(wlts_bdc, "deter_amazonia_legal")
```

### Trajectory

LULC trajectories can be extracted from collections. These LULC trajectories in WLTS services are associated with a point (lat, long) in geographic space. In `rwlts`, we can use the `get_trajectory` function to retrieve trajectories. For example, in the code below, the point `(-54, -12)` trajectory is retrieved from the `mapbiomas5_amazonia` collection.

``` {r}
get_trajectory(wlts_bdc, 
               latitude = -12, 
               longitude = -54, 
               collections = "mapbiomas5_amazonia")
```


The `get_trajectory` function returns a `list` of class `wlts`. This object contains the `query` and `result` attributes. The `query` attribute stores the query performed to retrieve the data. By default, it will be `NULL`. For this information to be stored, the `query_info = TRUE` parameter is required. For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_trajectory(wlts_bdc, 
               latitude = -12, 
               longitude = -54, 
               collections = "mapbiomas5_amazonia", 
               query_info = TRUE)
```

The `result` attribute stores the retrieved trajectories. The data is stored in a `tibble` for easy manipulation, which has the columns:

- `class`: LULC class;
- `collection`: Data Collection;
- `date`: Time instants of the trajectory;
- `point_id`: ID of the point that was queried.

The `point_id` column of the result `tibble` is used in `rwlts` to identify the entry point. This ID is necessary since the `get_trajectory` function can be used with vectors as input. For example, the code below retrieves the trajectory of data from the `mapbiomas5_amazonia` collection for two points `(-54, -12)` and `(-54, -11.01)`.

```{r}
get_trajectory(wlts_bdc, 
               latitude = c(-12, -11.01), 
               longitude = c(-54, -54), 
               collections = "mapbiomas5_amazonia")
```

In this case, the point `(-54, -12)` will have `point_id` equal to 1, while `(-54, -11.01)` will have `point_id` equal to 2.

In addition to multiple point retrieval, the `get_trajectory` function allows multiple collections to be queried for the composition of the trajectory. To do this, in the `collections` parameter, the collections must be assigned. For example, data from the collections `mapbiomas5_amazonia` and `terraclass_amazonia` are retrieved in the code below.

```{r}
get_trajectory(wlts_bdc, 
               latitude = c(-12, -11.01), 
               longitude = c(-54, -54), 
               collections = "mapbiomas5_amazonia,terraclass_amazonia")
```

Finally, the `get_trajectory` function, through the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters, allows you to specify the time intervals used in the trajectory. To exemplify its use, in the code below, trajectories are retrieved for the points `(-54, -12)` and `(-54, -11.01)`, from the `mapbiomas5_amazonia` and `terraclass_amazonia` collections in the time interval `[2003-01-01, 2004-01-01]`.

```{r}
get_trajectory(wlts_bdc, 
               latitude = c(-12, -11.01), 
               longitude = c(-54, -54), 
               start_date = "2003-01-01",
               end_date = "2004-01-01",
               collections = "mapbiomas5_amazonia,terraclass_amazonia")
```

The `rwlts` uses the **httr** package to manage HTTP requests, allowing the use of tokens from the authorization protocols OAuth 1.0 or 2.0 as well as other configuration options. In the code below, we present an example of how to provide a parameter token on a HTTP request.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_token <- "..."

get_trajectory(wlts_bdc, 
               latitude = c(-12, -11.01), 
               longitude = c(-54, -54), 
               collections = "mapbiomas5_amazonia,terraclass_amazonia",
               config = httr::add_headers("x-api-key" = my_token))
```

### Sankey plot

To visualize the trajectories and fully understand their time dynamics, the `rwlts` package implements the Sankey-based visualization method. To create this plot, use the `plot_sankey` function, as shown in the example below:

``` {r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4}
# import data from package
data("mt_500_mapbiomas_cerrado")

plot_sankey(mt_500_mapbiomas_cerrado)
```

Besides, you can fully customize the returned plot. This customization is possible since the `plot_sankey` function returns a ggplot2 object.


```{r, fig.width = 10}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggalluvial) # use to create plot
library(cowplot)    # use different theme

plot_sankey(mt_500_mapbiomas_cerrado, show_count_transition = TRUE) + 
  cowplot::theme_minimal_hgrid() + 
  labs(title = "Changes in Primavera do Leste (2004-2014)",
       x = "Timeline",
       y = "Number of points",
       fill = "Class") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#129912",
                               "#32CD32",
                               "#BDB76B",
                               "#FFD966",
                               "#FFFFB2"),
                    labels = c("Formação Florestal",
                               "Formação Savânica",
                               "Outras Lavouras Temporárias",
                               "Pastagem",
                               "Soja"))
```

> The numbers inside each bar correspond to the quantity of points extracted in each year. You can see that according to the change of LULC classes, the quantity of points in each class also changes.
